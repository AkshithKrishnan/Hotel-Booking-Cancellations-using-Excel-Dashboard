Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis – Excel Dashboard
Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking cancellation data to identify patterns that influence cancellations. An interactive Excel dashboard was created to visualize cancellation trends and key factors affecting booking behavior, supporting data-driven insights for hotel management decisions.

Dataset Information

The dataset contains historical hotel booking records, including booking status (cancelled or not), lead time, hotel type, customer details, and booking channels. The data was cleaned to remove inconsistencies and prepare it for analysis before building the dashboard.

Dataset Source: Public hotel booking dataset (e.g., Kaggle)

⚠️ If it’s Kaggle, say Kaggle. If not, replace this line. Don’t lie.
